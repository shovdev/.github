## What is Shov?

Shov is a serverless data layer built on Cloudflare's global network, designed to eliminate all setup friction for developers building modern applications. It provides four core data primitives with zero configuration:

-   **Key/Value Store:** For configuration, sessions, and simple data.
-   **JSON Collections:** For structured objects like users, products, or logs.
-   **File Storage:** For any file type, delivered globally via CDN.
-   **Vector Search:** For powerful semantic search across all your data.

Every piece of data you write to the Key/Value store or a Collection is **automatically embedded and indexed** for vector search, giving your application an AI-native memory out of the box.

## Blazing Fast Performance

Shov is built on Cloudflare's global network to deliver consistent, low-latency performance wherever your users are.

| Metric          | Typical Latency | Description                  |
| --------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Edge Reads**  | `~50ms`         | Cached reads at the edge.    |
| **Cold Reads**  | `~62ms`         | Uncached reads from origin.  |
| **Edge Writes** | `~55ms`         | Writes replicated globally.  |

## Quick Start: Zero to AI Memory in 30 Seconds

You don't need an account or credit card to get started.

### 1. Install the CLI
```bash
npm install -g shov
```

### 2. Create Your Project
This single command provisions a new project on Cloudflare's global network, instantly giving you a database, file storage, a vector index, and a secure API key. No sign-up required.

```bash
shov new my-first-project
#
# ✔ Project 'my-first-project' created
# ✔ API Key: shov_live_...
#
```

### 3. Start Building
Your backend is ready. Use your new API key with the CLI or SDKs to start building.

**Example A: Simple Key/Value**
```bash
# Set a value at the edge
shov set greeting "Hello from Shov"

# Get it back instantly from anywhere
shov get greeting
# > "Hello from Shov"
```

**Example B: AI-Powered Collections**
```bash
# Add a collection of items
shov add-many products '[
  { "name": "Fender Stratocaster", "type": "Electric Guitar" },
  { "name": "Ibanez RG550", "type": "Electric Guitar" },
  { "name": "Roland TD-27KV", "type": "Electronic Drums" }
]'

# Find them with semantic search
shov search "a stringed instrument" -c products
# > [
# >   { "name": "Fender Stratocaster", "type": "Electric Guitar" },
# >   { "name": "Ibanez RG550", "type": "Electric Guitar" }
# > ]

# Advanced search with filters and JSON output
shov search "musical equipment" --filters '{"type": "Electric Guitar"}' --json

# See all items in your project
shov contents

# Clear a collection
shov clear products
```

That's it. You now have a fully-featured, globally-replicated backend with AI search capabilities.
